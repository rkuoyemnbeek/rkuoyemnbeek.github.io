## Biography

![foto_Koen](afb_fb.png){:height="250px" width="250px" align="left"}

I am a Phd candidate at the NUMA research unit at KU Leuven working on subspace methods for eigenvalue problems.

For my masters thesis, I worked on algorithms for CT-scanning (something completely different, but nevertheless very interesting!).

On my [github page](https://github.com/rkuoyemnbeek), you can find the code used in my publications and some other smaller projects.

## Interests:
1. Numerical Linear Algebra
2. Eigenvalue problems
3. Tensor decompositions
4. Algorithms for CT-scanning




## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rkuoyemnbeek/rkuoyemnbeek.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rkuoyemnbeek/rkuoyemnbeek.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
